# Module 5: Will Your Future Be in Cybersecurity?

Welcome to this module, which outlines the vast number of career opportunities that exist today in the cybersecurity industry. With the right support and guidance, you can build the skills that many organizations are seeking right now to help them tackle threats of the future.

And let’s not forget that there are many legal and ethical issues that arise when working in cybersecurity. It’s critical that you understand your obligations so that you know how to do the right thing and act within the bounds of the law.


## 1. Legal and Ethical Issues

### 5.1.1 Legal Issues in Cybersecurity

In order to protect against attacks, cybersecurity professionals must have the same skills as the attackers. However, cybersecurity professionals use their skills within the bounds of the law.

> Personal legal issues

At work or home, you may have the opportunity and skills to hack another person’s computer or network. But there is an old saying, 'Just because you can does not mean you should.' Most hacks leave tracks, which can be traced back to you.

Cybersecurity professionals develop many skills, which can be used positively or illegally. There is always a huge demand for those who choose to put their cyber skills to good use within legal bounds.

> Corporate legal issues

Most countries have cybersecurity laws in place, which businesses and organizations must abide by.

In some cases, if you break cybersecurity laws while doing your job, the organization may be punished and you could lose your job. In other cases, you could be prosecuted, fined and possibly sentenced.

In general, if you are unsure whether an action or behavior might be illegal, assume that it is illegal and do not do it. Always check with the legal or HR department in the organization.

> International law and cybersecurity

International cybersecurity law is a constantly evolving field. Cyber attacks take place in cyberspace, an electronic space created, maintained and owned by both the public and private entities. There are no traditional geographic boundaries in cyberspace. To further complicate issues, it is much easier to mask the source of a attack in cyberwarfare than in conventional warfare.

The global society is still debating how best to deal with cyberspace. Country practice, opinio juris (a sense on behalf of a country that it is bound to the law in question) and any treaties drafted will shape international cybersecurity law.

In addition to working within the confines of the law, you must also be able to demonstrate ethical behavior and act responsibly in your work.

Let’s consider an example.

###  5.1.2 Ethical Issues in Cybersecurity

Think back to the pen test you carried out for @Apollo. This test revealed that one of your colleagues, who started at the same time as you, was responsible for a data breach. You are thinking of not including this in your report as they might get in trouble.

Ask yourself the following questions to help you decide on the best course of action.

* Is it legal?
* Does your action comply with @Apollo policy?
* Will your action be favorable for @Apollo and its stakeholders?
* Would it be okay if everyone in @Apollo took this action?
* Would the outcome of your action represent @Apollo in a positive light in a news headline?

If you are able to answer ‘Yes’ to all of these questions, then it’s likely to be appropriate to move forward with your action.

However, it's important to remember that just because something is legal, it may not be ethical.

In this case, while withholding the information from your pen test report is not illegal, it is not the ethical thing to do. The consequences of not reporting it could be devastating for @Apollo and its customers.

If your response to any of these questions is ‘No,’ you should stop and reconsider your actions, which could have serious legal ramifications for you and the organization.

In this example, you are right to question your initial thoughts. Every new finding in cybersecurity must be reported to protect @Apollo and its customers.

Remember, always seek advice from your line manager or a legal or HR representative to clarify if your action or behavior might be considered unethical.

###  5.1.4 Corporate Ethical Issues

Many professional IT organizations such as the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) have published Codes of Ethics to help guide employee actions and behaviors.

Cisco also has a team devoted exclusively to ethical business conduct and a Code of Business Conduct to help employees make business decisions and resolve any issues they may encounter.
