# Module 3: Protecting your Data and Privacy

Welcome to this module, which looks at how to protect yourself online and maintain your privacy.

Remember, your online data is valuable to cybercriminals. So what can you do to stay safe?

There are some simple strategies that you can use to protect your personal devices and maintain your data securely. Let’s take a look at what these are.

## 1. Protecting Your Devices and Network

You’ve probably heard of the term ‘online security.’ It’s all about taking the necessary steps to prevent your personal information from falling into the wrong hands.

Let’s start by seeing what you already know…

### 3.1.1 What Do You Think? 

You’ve just been issued with a new laptop at @Apollo and are getting ready to set it up. What steps would you take to secure it before use?

Write your thoughts in the box below, then Submit. Once you have entered the steps, select Show answer to reveal the feedback.

What did you come up with?

To make your device safe and secure, you should:

* turn the firewall on
* install antivirus and antispyware
* manage your operating system and browser
* set up password protection.

We’ll look at each of these in more detail next.

### 3.1.2 Protecting Your Computing Devices 

Your computing devices are the portal to your online life, storing a lot of your personal data. Therefore, it’s important to protect the security of your devices.

Select the headings for some top tips on how to do this.

> Turn the firewall on: 

You should use at least one type of firewall (either a software firewall or a hardware firewall on a router) to protect your device from unauthorized access. The firewall should be turned on and constantly updated to prevent hackers from accessing your personal or organization data.

You can click here to learn how to turn on the firewall in Windows 10, or click here for Mac OS X devices.

> Install antivirus and antispyware

Malicious software, such as viruses and spyware, are designed to gain unauthorized access to your computer and your data. Once installed, viruses can destroy your data and slow down your computer. They can even take over your computer and broadcast spam emails using your account. Spyware can monitor your online activities, collect your personal information or produce unwanted pop-up ads on your web browser while you are online.

To prevent this, you should only ever download software from trusted websites. However, you should always use antivirus software to provide another layer of protection. This software, which often includes antispyware, is designed to scan your computer and incoming email for viruses and delete them. Keeping your software up to date will protect your computer from any new malicious software that emerges.

> Manage your operating system and browser

Hackers are always trying to take advantage of vulnerabilities that may exist in your operating system (such as Microsoft Windows or macOS) or web browser (such as Google Chrome or Apple Safari).

Therefore, to protect your computer and your data, you should set the security settings on your computer and browser to medium level or higher. You should also regularly update your computer’s operating system, including your web browser, and download and install the latest software patches and security updates from the vendors.

> Set up password protection

All of your computing devices, including PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones, should be password protected to prevent unauthorized access. Any stored information, especially sensitive or confidential data, should be encrypted. You should only store necessary information on your mobile device, in case it is stolen or lost.

Remember, if any one of your devices is compromised, the criminals may be able to access all of your data through your cloud storage service provider, such as iCloud or Google Drive.



IoT devices pose an even greater risk than your other computing devices. While desktop, laptop and mobile platforms receive frequent software updates, most IoT devices have their original software. If vulnerabilities are found in the software, the IoT device is likely to be vulnerable. And to make the problem worse, IoT devices require Internet access, most often relying on your local network. The result is that when IoT devices are compromised, they allow hackers access to your local network and data. The best way to protect yourself from this scenario is to set up any IoT devices on an isolated network.

Check out Shodan, a web-based IoT device scanner that helps you identify any vulnerable devices on the Internet.

### 3.1.3 Wireless Network Security at Home

Wireless networks allow Wi-Fi enabled devices, such as laptops and tablets, to connect to the network by way of a preset network identifier, known as the service set identifier (SSID). Although a wireless router can be configured so that it doesn’t broadcast the SSID, this should not be considered adequate security for a wireless network.

Hackers will be aware of the preset SSID and default password. Therefore, these details should be changed to prevent intruders from entering your home wireless network. Furthermore, you should encrypt wireless communication by enabling wireless security and the WPA2 encryption feature on your wireless router. But be aware, even with WPA2 encryption enabled, a wireless network can still be vulnerable.

Select the image to find out more about the discovery of a security flaw in the WPA2 protocol in 2017.

This vulnerability can be exploited by key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs) by intruders. In simple terms, attackers break the encryption between a wireless router and a wireless device, giving them access to network data. This flaw affects all modern, protected Wi-Fi networks.

To mitigate this situation, you should:

* update all wireless capable devices such as routers, laptops and mobile devices, as soon as security updates become available
* use a wired connection for any devices with a wired network interface card (NIC)
* use a trusted virtual private network (VPN) service when accessing a wireless network.

Click here to find out more about KRACK.

### 3.1.4 Public Wi-Fi Risks 

When you are away from home, you can access your online information and surf the Internet via public wireless networks or Wi-Fi hotspots. However, there are some risks involved, which mean that it is best not to access or send any personal information when using public Wi-Fi.

You should always verify that your device isn’t configured with file and media sharing and that it requires user authentication with encryption.

You should also use an encrypted VPN service to prevent others from intercepting your information (known as ‘eavesdropping’) over a public wireless network. This service gives you secure access to the Internet, by encrypting the connection between your device and the VPN server. Even if hackers intercept a data transmission in an encrypted VPN tunnel, they will not be able to decipher it.

Click here to find out more about protecting yourself when using wireless networks.


Don’t forget that the Bluetooth wireless protocol, found on many smartphones and tablets, can also be exploited by hackers to eavesdrop, establish remote access controls, distribute malware and drain batteries!

Therefore, my top tip is to keep Bluetooth turned off when you aren’t using it.

### 3.1.5 Password Security

You’ve logged into your new laptop and it has prompted you to change your network password. You already struggle to remember the few passwords you use for your personal accounts online.

You ask one of your colleagues for their advice. They tell you to use one of the passwords you use for your personal accounts — that’s what they do! They keep their personal passwords written down at the back of their diary, just in case they forget them.

How would you rate your colleague’s attitude to password security on a scale of 1 (bad practice) to 5 (good practice)? 

Make your choice by sliding the marker on the scale, then Submit.

You’ve correctly identified that your colleague is advocating bad password practice and improved your privacy settings. Check your progress by clicking on the icon in the top right-hand corner of your screen.

It’s important that all of your online accounts have a unique password. Using the same passwords leaves you and your data vulnerable to cybercriminals.

And if it becomes too much to remember all of these passwords, you should use a password manager. This tool stores and encrypts all of your passwords and helps you log into your accounts automatically.

### 3.1.6 A Strong Password 

### 3.1.7 Using a Passphrase 

In order to prevent unauthorized access to your devices, you should consider using passphrases instead of passwords. A passphrase generally takes the form of a sentence (‘Acat th@tlov3sd0gs.’), making it easier for you to remember. And because it’s longer than a typical password, it’s less vulnerable to dictionary or brute-force attacks.

Here are a few tips for creating a good passphrase.

### 3.1.8 Password Guidelines

The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published improved password requirements. NIST standards are intended for government applications but can serve as a standard for other sectors as well.

These guidelines aim to place responsibility for user verification on service providers and ensure a better experience for users overall. They state:

* Passwords should be at least eight characters, but no more than 64 characters.
* Common, easily guessed passwords, such as ‘password’ or ‘abc123’ should not be used.
* There should be no composition rules, such as having to include lower and uppercase letters and numbers.
* Users should be able to see the password when typing, to help improve accuracy.
* All printing characters and spaces should be allowed.
* There should be no password hints.
* There should be no password expiration period.
* There should be no knowledge-based authentication, such as having to provide answers to secret questions or verify transaction history.

### 3.1.9 Password Check

That’s right, well done!

By identifying and choosing the strong passwords, you’ve improved your privacy settings. Click on the icon in the top right-hand corner to see how you are doing.

Don’t forget that passwords are widely used to prevent unauthorized access to your data and resources. So, to protect yourself and stay ahead of the attackers, make sure to always follow the guidance provided in this topic and create strong, unique passwords for all of your online accounts.

## 2. Data Maintenance

Are you ready to share all of your photos with strangers? Your financial information with your friends? Your email passwords with the general public? No? Then your data must be encrypted.

### 3.2.1 What Is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting information into a form in which unauthorized parties cannot read it. Only a trusted, authorized person with the secret key or password can decrypt the data and access it in its original form.

Note that the encryption itself does not prevent someone from intercepting the data. It can only prevent an unauthorized person from viewing or accessing the content. In fact, some criminals may decide to simply encrypt your data and make it unusable until you pay a ransom.

### 3.2.2 How Do You Encrypt Your Data? 

Software programs are used to encrypt files, folders and even entire drives.

Encrypting File System (EFS) is a Windows feature that can encrypt data. It is directly linked to a specific user account and only the user that encrypts the data will be able to access it after it has been encrypted using EFS.

Select the headings to discover how to encrypt data using EFS in all Windows versions.


Consider the amount of valuable data you have stored on your mobile phone or laptop. You probably have important documents, contact information and family photos!

So imagine if your mobile phone was stolen or you lost your laptop. All that information would be lost... unless you have it backed up!

### 3.2.3 Back Up Your Data

Having a backup may prevent the loss of irreplaceable data. To back up data properly, you will need an additional storage location for the data and you must copy the data to that location regularly.

Select the pins to explore some of these additional storage locations.

> Home network

Storing your data locally means that you have total control of it.

> Secondary location

You could copy all of your data to a network attached storage device (NAS), a simple external hard drive or maybe even back up important folders on thumb drives, CDs, DVDs or tapes. In this scenario, you are the owner of the data and you are totally responsible for the cost and maintenance of the storage device equipment.

> The cloud

You could subscribe to a cloud storage service, like Amazon Web Services (AWS). The cost of this service will depend on the amount of storage space you need, so you may need to be more selective about what data you back up. You will have access to your backup data as long as you have access to your account.

One of the benefits of using a cloud storage service is that your data is safe in the event of a storage device failure or if you experience an extreme situation such as a fire or theft.

### 3.2.4 Are They Really Gone? 

You’ve logged into your laptop but it contains some photos belonging to the previous user, who no longer works at @Apollo. Your line manager asks you to delete them. You drag the photos into the recycle bin, open the recycle bin, select them and click ‘Delete’ once again. That should do it!

Do you think the photos are really gone from the laptop?

Select the correct answer, then Submit.

That’s right!

When you move a file to the recycle bin and delete it permanently, the file is only inaccessible from the operating system. Anyone with the right forensic tools could still recover the file due to a magnetic trace left on the hard drive.

So how do you ensure that erased data is no longer recoverable? Let’s see…

### 3.2.5 How Do You Delete Your Data Permanently?

Have you ever had to delete data or get rid of a hard drive? If so, did you take any precautions to safeguard the data to keep it from falling into the wrong hands?

Select the images to find out what you should do to ensure you delete your files securely and permanently.

To erase data so that it is no longer recoverable, it must be overwritten with ones and zeroes multiple times, using tools specifically designed to do just that. SDelete from Microsoft claims to have the ability to remove sensitive files completely. Shred for Linux and Secure Empty Trash for Mac OS X claim to provide a similar service.

The only way to be certain that data or files are not recoverable is to physically destroy the hard drive or storage device. Many criminals have taken advantage of files thought to be impenetrable or irrecoverable!

Don’t forget about data that may be stored online in the cloud. These copies will also need to be deleted.

 Next Up...

Take a moment to consider where you save your data. Is it backed up and encrypted? Why not put some of the information from this topic into practice and keep your valuable information safe and secure?

You should also be aware of how your personal data will be treated when you enter into a service agreement with an online service provider.

## 4. Safeguarding Your Online Privacy

### 3.4.1 Two Factor Authentication

Popular online services, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Apple and Microsoft, use two factor authentication to add an extra layer of security for account logins.

Besides your username and password or personal identification number (PIN), two factor authentication requires a second token to verify your identity. This may be a:

    physical object such as a credit card, mobile phone or fob
    biometric scan such as a fingerprint or facial and voice recognition
    verification code sent via SMS or email.

Click here to find out more about two factor authentication.

Be careful!

Even with two factor authentication, hackers can still gain access to online accounts through phishing attacks, malware and social engineering.

### 3.4.2 Open Authorization

Open authorization (OAuth) is an open standard protocol that allows you to use your credentials to access third-party applications without exposing your password.

Select the arrows to see what this means in practice.

You are looking forward to registering for Cisco’s ‘Cybersecurity Essentials,’ the next course in this series, to help you develop your career. But you must be logged into the eLearning portal to do so.

You can’t remember your login details, but that’s OK. The portal gives you the option of logging in using your credentials from a social media website such as Facebook or via another account such as Google.

So instead of having to reset your login details, you log into the eLearning portal using your existing social media accounts and register for your next course with ease. You can’t wait to get started!

###  3.4.3 Social Sharing

Select the two correct answers, then Submit.

That’s right!

You’ve shared just the right amount of information and boosted your online privacy settings. Click the icon in the top right-hand corner to check your progress.

In order to safeguard your privacy on social media, it’s important to share as little personal information as possible. You should also check your social media settings so that only people you know can see your activities or engage in conversations with you.

The more information you share online, the easier it is for someone to create a profile about you and take advantage of you, both online and offline.

###  3.4.4 Don't Get Spoofed

This is a media player component. Select the play / pause button to watch or listen.

A simple forged or spoofed email can lead to a massive data breach and perhaps cause irreversible damage to your reputation.

Press the play button to find out how.

The Internet is a great tool for not only accessing information quickly and easily but also for communicating with friends, family and colleagues. But did you know that anyone with physical access to your device or router can view what websites you’ve visited? And that every time you send an email, it is readable by anyone who has access to the digital chain between you and your recipient?

So, what can you do?

###  3.4.5 Email and Web Browser Privacy

These problems can be minimized by enabling the in-private browsing mode on your web browser. Many of the most commonly used web browsers have their own name for private browser mode:

    Microsoft Internet Explorer: InPrivate

    Google Chrome: Incognito

    Mozilla Firefox: Private tab or private window

    Safari: Private browsing

Select the image to find out how private mode works.

When private mode is enabled, cookies — files saved to your device to indicate what websites you’ve visited — are disabled. Therefore, any temporary internet files are removed and your browsing history is deleted when you close the window or program. This may help to prevent others from gathering information about your online activities and trying to entice you to buy something with targeted ads.

Even with private browsing enabled and cookies disabled, companies are constantly developing new ways of fingerprinting users in order to track their online behavior. For example, some intermediary devices, like routers, can gather information about a user’s web surfing history.

 Next Up...

Ultimately, it is your responsibility to safeguard your data, your identity and your computing devices. So, the next time you go to send an email or browse the Internet, why not check to make sure you’re following all the guidelines outlined in this module? Just a few simple precautions now could save you from having to deal with problems later.

Let's see if you can recognize risky online behavior.

## 5. Discover Your Own Risky Online Behavior

###  3.5.1 Scenario 1

Do you know what information is safe to share on social media sites? 

It’s surprising what people post on social media without thinking! Which of the following do you think poses a risk if posted on social media?

That’s right!

Photos showing bank details or valuable goods and vacation information always put you at risk, and especially when you’ve previously given clues about where you live, or where you are going to visit. Always stop and think about what you are about to post — would you tell it to a complete stranger?!

###  3.5.2 Scenario 2

When creating a new account in an online service, what password do you use? Is it secure?

In your own words, describe what a password manager application is, how they work and why they are beneficial. If you have used a password manager before, outline a few details and share your experience.

Write your thoughts in the box, then Submit. Select Show answer to check your response.

Password manager applications can protect passwords by saving them in a secure encrypted form. They enable random passwords to be generated and managed easily, averting the need for users to have the same password for multiple accounts, which presents a security risk.

### 3.5.3 Scenario 3

Connecting to an open Wi-Fi hotspot can make your system and data vulnerable to an attack.

@Apollo’s Sales Manager is traveling to meet a client. She forgot to download the contract from @Apollo’s server to bring to the meeting with her. The train has an open Wi-Fi network. She contacts you to ask what she should do. What would you advise?

That’s right!

The Sales Manager can use the VPN connection on her laptop to create a secure, encrypted channel back to @Apollo, on top of the untrusted open Wi-Fi network. This way, all the traffic from her laptop will be securely transferred over the secure VPN tunnel.

###  3.5.4 Scenario 4

Are you aware of the risks that come when downloading a trial version of a program?

A designer at @Apollo needs to install some image manipulation software. The mainstream application is really expensive, and it’s only needed for one small piece of a one-off project. The Design Manager says this would not be a cost-effective purchase and says to install an alternative free application instead — the manager doesn’t mind if it’s from an untrusted source as they feels the risks are low. Should the designer take the manager’s advice?

That’s right!

The designer should check with a member of the IT team before installing any applications from a non-trusted source, even if it was advised by a manager. No organization can afford to take the risk of a cyber attack from installing applications from an untrusted source.

###  3.5.5 Scenario 5

Have you ever had a warning message telling you to download a diagnostics program that will make your computer safe? You should be aware of the risks.

This message appears while you are online. Which of the following actions should you take?

That’s right.

Clicking anything other than the close icon could put your system at risk.

To be sure, you should run a system security scan with your trusted antivirus software on your computer. And you should always refuse or cancel update reminders unless you are sure they are from the official, trusted source.

###  3.5.6 Scenario 6

Clicking on links in an email might seem safe, but often all is not what it seems. Make sure you know the signs to look out for!

That’s right!

The key indications of a potential phishing email are signs that it has been sent from outside of the organization.

Remember that even if you think the email is safe, you should always check with your IT department before clicking links to download anything.
