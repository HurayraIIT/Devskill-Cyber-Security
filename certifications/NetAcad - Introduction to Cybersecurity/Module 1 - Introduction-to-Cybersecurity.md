## The World of Cybersecurity

### 1.1.1 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.

- Personal: On a personal level, you need to safeguard your identity, your data, and your computing devices.
- Organizational: At an organizational level, it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the organization’s reputation, data and customers.
- Government: As more digital information is being gathered and shared, its protection becomes even more vital at the government level, where national security, economic stability and the safety and wellbeing of citizens are at stake.

### 1.1.2 Protecting Your Personal Data 

Personal data is any information that can be used to identify you, and it can exist both offline and online.

> Offline identity

Your offline identity is the real-life persona that you present on a daily basis at home, at school or at work. As a result, family and friends know details about your personal life, including your full name, age and address.

It’s important not to overlook the importance of securing your offline identity. Identity thieves can easily steal your data from right under your nose when you’re not looking!

> Online identity

Your online identity is not just a name. It’s who you are and how you present yourself to others online. It includes the username or alias you use for your online accounts, as well as the social identity you establish and portray on online communities and websites.

You should take care to limit the amount of personal information you reveal through your online identity. 

Many people think that if they don’t have any social media or online accounts set up, then they don’t have an online identity. This is not the case. If you use the web, you have an online identity.

### 1.1.3 Your Online Identity 

It’s your first day on the job, and it’s time to choose a username for your online identity. Which of the following options would you choose?

This is your first chance to gain some valuable defender points at eLearning company @Apollo, so take your time and think carefully before making your choices.

Choose two correct answers, then Submit.

* j.doe12
* jdoe.IT

That’s not quite right.

When choosing a username, it’s important not to reveal any personal information. 

Some other useful tips to help you generate your username:

* Don’t use your email username.
* Don’t use your full name or parts of your address or phone number.
* Don’t use the same username and password combination, especially on financial accounts.
* Don’t choose a super-odd username and then reuse it again and again — it makes you easier to track.
* Don’t choose a username that gives clues to your passwords such as a series of numbers/letters, the first part of a two-part phrase, such as knock-knock or starlight, or the department in which you work, such as IT.
* Do choose a username that’s appropriate for the type of account, i.e., business, social or personal.

Go back, reset and have another try.

* j.doe12
* jdoe

That’s right, well done! You sure know how to keep your online identity safe.

### 1.1.4 Your Data 

Personal data describes any information about you, including your name, social security number, driver license number, date and place of birth, your mother’s maiden name, and even pictures or messages that you exchange with family and friends.

Cybercriminals can use this sensitive information to identify and impersonate you, infringing on your privacy and potentially causing serious damage to your reputation.


> Medical records

Every time you visit the doctor, personal information regarding your physical and mental health and wellbeing is added to your electronic health records (EHRs). Since the majority of these records are saved online, you need to be aware of the medical information that you share.

And these records go beyond the bounds of the doctor’s office. For example, many fitness trackers collect large amounts of clinical data such as your heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar levels, which is transferred, stored and displayed via the cloud. Therefore, you should consider this data to be part of your medical records.

> Education records

Educational records contain information about your academic qualifications and achievements. However, these records may also include your contact information, attendance records, disciplinary reports, health and immunization records as well as any special education records including individualized education programs (IEPs).

> Employment and financial records

Employment data can be valuable to hackers if they can gather information on your past employment, or even your current performance reviews.

Your financial records may include information about your income and expenditure. Your tax records may include paychecks, credit card statements, your credit rating and your bank account details. All of this data, if not safeguarded properly, can compromise your privacy and enable cybercriminals to use your information for their own gain.

### 1.1.5 Where Is Your Data?

This has got you thinking. Only yesterday, you shared a couple of photos of your first day on the job with a few of your close friends. But that should be OK, right? Let’s see…

You took some photos at work on your mobile phone. Copies of these photos are now available on your mobile device.

You shared these with five close friends, who live in various locations across the world.

All of your friends downloaded the photos and now have copies of your photos on their devices.

One of your friends was so proud that they decided to post and share your photos online. The photos are no longer just on your device. They have in fact ended up on servers located in different parts of the world and people whom you don’t even know now have access to your photos.

### 1.1.6 What's More... 

This is just one example that reminds us that every time we collect or share personal data, we should consider our security. There are different laws that protect your privacy and data in your country. But do you know where your data is?

Following an appointment, the doctor will update your medical record. For billing purposes, this information may be shared with the insurance company. In such cases, your medical record, or part of it, is now accessible at the insurance company.

Store loyalty cards may be a convenient way to save money on your purchases. However, the store is using this card to build a profile of your purchasing behavior, which it can then use to target you with special offers from its marketing partners.

### 1.1.7 Smart Devices 

Consider how often you use your computing devices to access your personal data. Unless you have chosen to receive paper statements, you probably access digital copies of bank account statements via your bank’s website. And when paying a bill, it’s highly likely that you’ve transferred the required funds via a mobile banking app.

But besides allowing you to access your information, computing devices can now also generate information about you.

Wearable technologies such as smartwatches and activity trackers collect your data for clinical research, patient health monitoring, and fitness and wellbeing tracking. As the global fitness tracker market grows, so also does the risk to your personal data.

It might seem that information available online is free. But is privacy the price we pay for this digital convenience?

For example, social media companies generate the majority of their income by selling targeted advertising based on customer data that has been mined using algorithms or formulas. Of course, these companies will argue that they are not ‘selling’ customer data, but ‘sharing’ customer data with their marketing partners.

You can make up your own mind!

### 1.1.8 What Do Hackers Want? 

So, with all this information about you available online, what do hackers want? Of course, they want your money.

Can you think of an example that you have experienced yourself or that you have heard or read about, where cybercriminals have accessed or tried to access financial information online?

Share your example in the box below, then Submit. Once you have entered your example, select Show answer to reveal a summary response.

```
There has been a rise of cyber attacks on our national and corporate infrastructures in the recent years. A recent survey shows that all of the 4 major telecom companies have more that 4 million malware infected devices that have been actively stealing information for a long time. Who knows how much data has already been stolen. These telecom companies are should be more aware of the cyber incidents and prepare accordingly because they are always a big target for the cyber criminals. That's all.
```

Were you able to think of at least one example?

A cybercriminal can take advantage of your relationships, accessing your online accounts and appealing to your good nature to try and trick you into wiring money to your friends or family in a time of need. For example, there have been many reported cases of hackers impersonating family members and sending messages stating that they need money wired in order to get home from abroad after losing their wallets.

And while you may think that your frequent flyer air miles are not valuable to cybercriminals, think again. In 2015, cybercriminals hacked approximately 10,000 American Airlines and United accounts, booking free flights and upgrades using stolen credentials. Even though the frequent flyer miles were returned to the customers by the airlines, this example demonstrates the value of your login credentials.

Cybercriminals are certainly very imaginative when it comes to gaining access to your money. But that’s not all they are after — they could also steal your identity and ruin your life.

Let’s find out more.

### 1.1.9 Identity Theft 

Not content with stealing your money for short-term financial gain, cybercriminals are invested in the long-term gain of identity theft.

> Medical theft

Rising medical costs have led to an increase in medical identity theft, with cybercriminals stealing medical insurance to use the benefits for themselves. Where this happens, any medical procedures carried out in your name will then be saved in your medical records.

> Banking

Stealing private data can help cybercriminals access bank accounts, credit cards, social profiles and other online accounts. Armed with this information, an identity thief could file a fake tax return and collect the refund. They could even take out loans in your name and ruin your credit rating (and your life as well).

### 1.1.10 Who Else Wants My Data? 

It’s not just criminals who seek your personal data.

> Your ISP

Your ISP tracks your online activity and, in some countries, they can sell this data to advertisers for a profit.

In certain circumstances, ISPs may be legally required to share your information with government surveillance agencies or authorities.

> Advertisers

Targeted advertising is part of the Internet experience. Advertisers monitor and track your online activities such as shopping habits and personal preferences and send targeted ads your way.

> Search engines and social media platforms

These platforms gather information about your gender, geolocation, phone number and political and religious ideologies based on your search histories and online identity. This information is then sold to advertisers for a profit.

> Websites you visit

Websites use cookies to track your activities in order to provide a more personalized experience. But this leaves a data trail that is linked to your online identity that can often end up in the hands of advertisers!

Next Up...

It’s obvious that cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated in their pursuit of valuable personal data. But they also pose a huge threat to organizational data.

Select Next to find out more.

## Organizational Data

Before you can start implementing best practices to safeguard organizational data, you need to know what it is. In organizations like eLearning company @Apollo, there are two main types of data that you should be aware of.

Let’s explore these now.

### 1.2.1 Types of Organizational Data 

#### 1.2.1.1 Traditional Data

Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small. It includes the following:

* Transactional data such as details relating to buying and selling, production activities and basic organizational operations such as any information used to make employment decisions.
* Intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, which allows an organization to gain economic advantage over its competitors. This information is often considered a trade secret and losing it could prove disastrous for the future of a company.
* Financial data such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which provide insight into the health of a company.

#### 1.2.1.2 Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data

IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. All of these ‘things’ are connected to the Internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it’s no surprise that the emergence of IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of interest in technology and business called 'Big Data.'

### 1.2.2 The Cube 

The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:

1. The foundational principles for protecting information systems.
2. The protection of information in each of its possible states.
3. The security measures used to protect data.


**The foundational principles for protecting information systems.**

> Confidentiality

Confidentiality is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and processes. Methods to ensure confidentiality include data encryption, identity proofing and two factor authentication.

> Integrity

Integrity ensures that system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. One way to ensure integrity is to use a hash function or checksum.

> Availability

Availability means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed and those that do not meet established conditions, are not. This can be achieved by maintaining equipment, performing hardware repairs, keeping operating systems and software up to date, and creating backups.

**The protection of information in each of its possible states.**

* Processing refers to data that is being used to perform an operation such as updating a database record (data in process).

* Storage refers to data stored in memory or on a permanent storage device such as a hard drive, solid-state drive or USB drive (data at rest).

* Transmission refers to data traveling between information systems (data in transit).

**The security measures used to protect data.**

* Awareness, training and education are the measures put in place by an organization to ensure that users are knowledgeable about potential security threats and the actions they can take to protect information systems.

* Technology refers to the software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems such as firewalls, which continuously monitor your network in search of possible malicious incidents.

* Policy and procedure refers to the administrative controls that provide a foundation for how an organization implements information assurance, such as incident response plans and best practice guidelines

### 1.2.3 What Do You Think? 

A concerned customer has forwarded on what they believe to be a fraudulent email. It looks as if it has been sent by @Apollo but something appears a little 'phish-y.'

Closer inspection reveals:

* that the sender's email domain is spelled incorrectly
* that the link URL is not pointing to @Apollo's website
* poor language, spelling and grammar
* low quality, pixelated graphics

Phishing emails can be hard to detect. For example, they will often address you by name to appear legitimate, but hackers can easily find this information on the Internet. So, it’s important to stay alert and think before you click.

### 1.2.4 Is This for Real? 

Yes, phishing is very common and often works. For example, in August 2020, elite gaming brand Razer experienced a data breach which exposed the personal information of approximately 100,000 customers.

A security consultant discovered that a cloud cluster (a group of linked servers providing data storage, databases, networking, and software through the Internet), was misconfigured and exposed a segment of Razer’s infrastructure to the public Internet, resulting in a data leak. 

It took Razer more than three weeks to secure the cloud instance from public access, during which time cybercriminals had access to customer information that could have been used in social engineering and fraud attacks, like the one you uncovered just now. 

Organizations therefore need to take a proactive approach to cloud security to ensure that sensitive data is secured.

### 1.2.5 Data Security Breaches 

The implications of a data security breach are severe, but they are becoming all too common.

> The Persirai botnet

In 2017, an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet, Persirai, targeted over 1,000 different models of Internet Protocol (IP) cameras, accessing open ports to inject a command that forced the cameras to connect to a site which installed malware on them. Once the malware was downloaded and executed, it deleted itself and was therefore able to run in memory to avoid detection.

Over 122,000 of these cameras from several different manufacturers were hijacked and used to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, without the knowledge of their owners. A DDoS attack occurs when multiple devices infected with malware flood the resources of a targeted system.

The IoT is connecting more and more devices, creating more opportunities for cybercriminals to attack.

> Equifax Inc.

In September 2017, Equifax, a consumer credit reporting agency in the United States, publicly announced a data breach event: Attackers had been able to exploit a vulnerability in its web application software to gain access to the sensitive personal data of millions of customers.

In response to this breach, Equifax established a dedicated website that allowed Equifax customers to determine if their information was compromised. However, instead of using a subdomain of equifax.com, the company set up a new domain name, which allowed cybercriminals to create unauthorized websites with similar names. These websites were used to try and trick customers into providing personal information.

Attackers could use this information to assume a customer’s identity. In such cases, it would be very difficult for the customer to prove otherwise, given that the hacker is also privy to their personal information.


If you are ever faced with a similar situation, quickly verify if your information was compromised, so that you can minimize the impact. Keep in mind that, in a time of crisis, you may be tricked into using unauthorized websites.

Always be vigilant when providing personally identifiable information over the Internet. Check your credit reports regularly and immediately report any false information, such as applications for credit that you did not initiate or purchases on your credit cards that you did not make.

### 1.2.6 Consequences of a Security Breach 

> Reputational Damage

A security breach can have a negative long-term impact on an organization’s reputation that has taken years to build. Customers, particularly those who have been adversely affected by the breach, will need to be notified and may seek compensation and/or turn to a reliable and secure competitor. Employees may also choose to leave in light of a scandal.

Depending on the severity of a breach, it can take a long time to repair an organization’s reputation.

> Vandalism

A hacker or hacking group may vandalize an organization’s website by posting untrue information. They might even just make a few minor edits to your organization’s phone number or address, which can be trickier to detect.

In either case, online vandalism can portray unprofessionalism and have a negative impact on your organization’s reputation and credibility.

> Theft

A data breach often involves an incident where sensitive personal data has been stolen. Cybercriminals can make this information public or exploit it to steal an individual’s money and/or identity.

> Loss of revenue

The financial impact of a security breach can be devastating. For example, hackers can take down an organization’s website, preventing it from doing business online. A loss of customer information may impede company growth and expansion. It may demand further investment in an organization’s security infrastructure. And let’s not forget that organizations may face large fines or penalties if they do not protect online data.

> Damaged Intellectual Property

A security breach could also have a devastating impact on the competitiveness of an organization, particularly if hackers are able to get their hands on confidential documents, trade secrets and intellectual property.


Despite the best of intentions and all the safeguards you can put in place, protecting organizations from every cyberattack is not feasible.

Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to attack and, eventually, they will succeed.

When they do, it will be up to cybersecurity professionals, like you, to respond quickly to minimize its impact.

## LAB: What was taken?

### 1.3.1 Scenario 1 

Security breaches today are all too common, with attackers constantly finding new and innovative ways of infiltrating organizations in search of valuable information.

### 1.3.2 What Happened?

According to our sources, a well known hotel chain that operates across the world has reported a massive data breach, with the personal information of over three million guests exposed to hackers.

The hotel discovered that hackers gained access to its customer database by using the login details of one of its employees.

At this point, the hotel doesn’t believe that the hackers were able to access any account passwords or financial information. Recent guests are encouraged to check the hotel chain’s web portal to see if they have been impacted by this breach.

*This is a fictional scenario.

This is a multiple choice question. Once you have selected an option, select the submit button below

In this example, what did the hackers take?

The hackers stole the personal information of over three million hotel guests. This included their names, email addresses and phone numbers.

### 1.3.3 Scenario 2

eLearning Platforms at Risk!

The team at @Apollo is concerned. eLearning platforms are becoming prime targets for attackers as more and more organizations make the move to digital learning.

Select the arrows to find out more about a recent case.*

A popular online training platform admitted leaving the personal data of millions of its students (many of them minors) exposed on a publicly accessible cloud database.

Hackers were able to directly access students’ full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and school enrollment details from the Internet!

While it’s unclear what the hackers have done with this acquired information, it’s safe to say that they have everything they need to carry out widespread phishing or malware attacks.

### 1.3.4 What Exploits? 

What exploits did the hackers use in this case to gain access to valuable personal information?

Hackers are targeting the increasing numbers of organizations who are migrating to the cloud or using cloud-based services and resources.

In this scenario, hackers were able to take advantage of an organization’s poor security practices. Unsecured cloud databases left exposed on the Internet present a huge vulnerability and one that attackers will seek to exploit to gain easy access to valuable organizational data.   

### 1.3.5 Rewind... 

Every organization is at risk of a cyber attack and therefore must take appropriate action to protect itself.

Thinking back to each of the two security breach examples outlined above, what measures could these organizations have implemented in order to have prevented these security breaches?

Write your thoughts in the box below, then Submit. Select Show answer to check your response.

In both cases, the organizations need to invest in improved security practices.

This might include:

* investing in cybersecurity training for all staff so that they are aware of and able to spot a cyber attack
* enforcing two factor authentication for employees accessing files and applications that contain sensitive data
* maintaining log files and ongoing monitoring to identify anomalous behavior that might indicate a data breach
* storing the passwords of customers using a combination of salting and robust hashing algorithms
* separating cloud-based resources from the public Internet into an isolated private network segment
* granting employee access to personal data and internal systems only via a secure VPN connection.

### 1.3.6 Key Takeaways 

A security breach is an incident that results in unauthorized access to data, applications, services or devices, exposing private information that attackers can use for financial gain or other advantages.

But there are many ways to protect yourself and your organization. It’s important to be aware of common cyber threats and remain vigilant so that you don’t become the next victim.

Given the very real threat to organizational data, it is critical that all organizations develop and implement a comprehensive cybersecurity plan to protect them from potential breaches. But who are they being protected from?

Select Next to find out more.

## Cyber Attackers

Attackers are individuals or groups who attempt to exploit vulnerability for personal or financial gain. As we’ve already seen, they are interested in everything, from credit cards to product designs!

###  1.4.1 Types of Attackers

Image with selectable areas. Select each button to show more information.

Let’s look at some of the main types of cyber attackers who’ll try anything to get their hands on our information. They are often categorized as white hat, gray hat or black hat attackers.

> Amateurs

The term 'script kiddies' emerged in the 1990s and refers to amateur or inexperienced hackers who use existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to launch attacks. Some script kiddies are just curious, others are trying to demonstrate their skills and cause harm. While these white hat attackers may use basic tools, their attacks can still have devastating consequences.

> Hackers

This group of attackers break into computer systems or networks to gain access. Depending on the intent of their break in, they can be classified as white, gray or black hat hackers.

* White hat attackers break into networks or computer systems to identify any weaknesses so that the security of a system or network can be improved. These break-ins are done with prior permission and any results are reported back to the owner.
* Gray hat attackers may set out to find vulnerabilities in a system but they will only report their findings to the owners of a system if doing so coincides with their agenda. Or they might even publish details about the vulnerability on the internet so that other attackers can exploit it.
* Black hat attackers take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain.

> Organized hackers

These attackers include organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists and state-sponsored hackers. They are usually highly sophisticated and organized, and may even provide cybercrime as a service to other criminals.

Hacktivists make political statements to create awareness about issues that are important to them.

State-sponsored attackers gather intelligence or commit sabotage on behalf of their government. They are usually highly trained and well-funded and their attacks are focused on specific goals that are beneficial to their government.

### 1.4.2 What Color Is My Hat? 

Now that you know the different types of attackers and their motivations for doing what they do, can you identify what color of hat is worn by the attacker in each of the following scenarios? This is a tricky one but remember, you can earn valuable defender points if you answer correctly.

You’ve got a really good understanding of the types of attackers out there and grabbed yourself some defender points. Make sure to check the icon in the top right hand corner of your screen to see how you are doing.

White hat attackers aim to discover security weaknesses so that they can be improved, whereas black hat attackers take advantage of any vulnerabilities for illegal personal, financial or political gain. Gray hat attackers are somewhere in between. While they may not have malicious intentions, they want to get something for their discovery.

And let’s not forget that threats don’t always come from the outside. Let’s take a closer look.

###  1.4.3 Internal and External Threats

Cyber attacks can originate from within an organization as well as from outside of it.

> Internal

Employees, contract staff or trusted partners can accidentally or intentionally:

* mishandle confidential data
* facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the organization’s computer system
* invite malware onto the organization’s network by clicking on malicious emails or websites
* threaten the operations of internal servers or network infrastructure devices.

> External

Amateurs or skilled attackers outside of the organization can:

* exploit vulnerabilities in the network
* gain unauthorized access to computing devices
* use social engineering to gain unauthorized access to organizational data.
    
### 1.4.4 What Do You Think? 

Remember that phishing email you received earlier from one of your customers?

An investigation into this email revealed that the user accounts and access privileges of a former employee were not fully removed from the IT systems on leaving the company. In fact, this former employee, who now works for a competitor, logged into @Apollo’s customer database only three days ago.

Has an internal or external security threat occurred here?

This ex-employee was able to launch an attack based on insider knowledge of the organization’s network. For this reason, internal threats have the potential to cause greater damage than external threats.

Don’t forget to check your defender points by clicking on the shield in the top right hand corner of your screen before moving on.

 Next Up...

The profile of a cyber attacker varies depending on their goals, motivations and capabilities. At the extreme, hackers can launch cyber attacks against nations and states, wreaking havoc on their computer systems and networks.

Select Next to continue.

## Cyberwarfare

Cyberwarfare, as its name suggests, is the use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s computer systems and networks in an effort to cause damage or disrupt services, such as shutting down a power grid.

###  1.5.1 Sign of the Times (Stuxnet)

This is a media player component. Select the play / pause button to watch or listen.

One example of a state-sponsored attack involved the Stuxnet malware that was designed not just to hijack targeted computers but to actually cause physical damage to equipment controlled by computers!

Press the play button to watch a short video on the case of Stuxnet and discover the impact this malware had on Iran’s nuclear enrichment plant.

### 1.5.2 The Purpose of Cyberwarfare 

The main reason for resorting to cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they are nations or competitors.


**To gather compromised information and/or defense secrets** 

A nation or international organization can engage in cyberwarfare in order to steal defense secrets and gather information about technology that will help narrow the gaps in its industries and military capabilities.

Furthermore, compromised sensitive data can give attackers leverage to blackmail personnel within a foreign government.


**To impact another nation’s infrastructure**

Besides industrial and military espionage, a nation can continuously invade another nation’s infrastructure in order to cause disruption and chaos.

For example, a cyber attack could shut down the power grid of a major city. Consider the consequences if this were to happen; roads would be congested, the exchange of goods and services would be halted, patients would not be able to get the care they would need if an emergency occurred, access to the internet would be interrupted. By shutting down a power grid, a cyber attack could have a huge impact on the everyday life of ordinary citizens.

Cyberwarfare can destabilize a nation, disrupt its commerce, and cause its citizens to lose faith and confidence in their government without the attacker ever physically setting foot in the targeted country.

 Next Up...

Cyberwarfare is a very serious issue with potentially devastating consequences, and attacks are becoming more widespread. Now, more than ever, nations and governments need cybersecurity professionals to help protect their citizens and infrastructure. You’ve started your cybersecurity career at the right time!
