Main components: client, server and protocols. Use cases: secure remote access and site-to-site.<br /><br />ZTNA: It applies the Zero Trust principal which is no user or device whether it is inside or outside of a network is trusted. It has enhanced security.<br /><br /><img src="images/42-1.png" alt="images/42-1.png" /><br /><br />How Does Fortinet ZTNA Work?<br /><br />Step 1 -&gt; Device Identity Validation<br /><br />	a. The Endpoint connects to the ZTNA access proxy<br />	b. FortiGate challenges the endpoint foe device identification<br />	c. Endpoint sends its certificates to FortiGate, which was previously issues by FortiClient EMS<br />	d. FortiGate applier the tags and rules associated with the device.<br /><br /><img src="images/42-2.png" alt="images/42-2.png" /><br /><br />Step 2 -&gt; User authentication<br /><br />	a. FortiGate asks endpoint for user authentication<br />	b. User sends their credentials on the endpoint<br />	c. FortGate forwards the creds to the authentication server (could be an AD, LDAP directory, a database or IDaaS)<br />	d. The user&#39;s identity is validated and its roles are retrieved from the authentication server<br />	e. The roles are used by FortiGate to determine access to the network application<br />	<br />	<img src="images/42-3.png" alt="images/42-3.png" /><br /><br />Step 3 -&gt; Encrypted Session is established<br /><br /><img src="images/42-4.png" alt="images/42-4.png" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
