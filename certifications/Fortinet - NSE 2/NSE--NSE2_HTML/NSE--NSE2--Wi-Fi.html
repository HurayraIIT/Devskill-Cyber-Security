<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Wi-Fi</h1><br/>2022/08/02 - 06:10:44 PM - Tuesday<br />Wi-Fi<br /><br />It is a technology for wireless, local area networking based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. <br /><br />Originally the authentication and privacy mechanisms for wifi were very weak. WEP (wired equivalent privacy) used a key to encrypt traffic using the RC4 keystream. But it could be compromised.<br /><br />Then IEEE and the wifi alliance produced WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access). It added extra security but still used RC4.<br /><br />Based on AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) from the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) a new standard was introduced named WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2). This was a lot more secure than WEP. WPA2 had 2 flavors. The personal level of security used a shared passphrase for network authentication and key exchange. The enterprise level security used 802.1x authentication mechanisms.<br /><br />WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) was introduced in 2018. It introduced a new, more secure handshake for making connections, an easier method for adding devices to the network, increased key sizes, and other security features.<br /><br />Fortinet offers a wireless product named FortiAP which intregates with and is managed by FortiGate, a NGFW.<br /></div>
